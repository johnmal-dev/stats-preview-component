### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was meant to be a quick refresher on HTML and CSS with the help of scss pre-processor.
Using SCSS variables is my favourite thing!
```scss css
// Primary
$main-bg: hsl(233, 47%, 7%);
$card-bg: hsl(244, 38%, 16%);
$accent: hsl(277, 64%, 61%);

// Neutral
$white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
$main-p: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.75);
$stats-headings: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.6);
```
### Useful resources

- [PureRef](https://www.pureref.com/) - This helps me compare the example images to my work. Highly recommend.
- [Sass/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - Using SCSS alongside an automatic compiler is the way to go. After fiddling with plain CSS and Less CSS, I have found Sass to be ideal for my workflow.
